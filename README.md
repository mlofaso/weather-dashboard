# weather-dashboard

Module 6 Challenge

## Description

Used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a weather search tool. Linked bootstrap for styling and multiple weather APIs to retrieve data. Was not able to finish full functionality, but at full functionality the site would also display a 5 day forecast, as well as prior searched cities.
